- Best developers maintain a direct connection to users.
- Conversely, it is often a bad sign if developers do not encounter *any* user feedback

<!-- 
- wufoo/37signals have developers take customer support calls once a week/month

# Product development lifecycle

1. Idea 💡
2. Launch something 🚀
3. Talk to users to see if it serves their needs 🗣️
4. Repeat 🔁

- Listen to what users say, but more importantly, **focus on what they do**.
<!-- - Listen for user problems (You can usually ignore their proposed solutions) -->
- If a user is "hacking" your product in a way you didn't expect, double down on that.

<!-- users own the problem, you own the solution -->

- How to talk to both current and potential users
- How to run a great user interview
- How to interpret the feedback in these conversations

# A useful conversation

- Talk about their life, not your idea.
- Talk specifics, not hypotheticals.
- Listen, don’t talk.


---

# Guidelines

- Ask about someone’s behavior, not hypotheticals.
- People will lie to you. It’s your job to make sure they don’t by asking correct questions.
- Questions you ask should terrify you. They could disprove what you’re researching.

# Bad Questions vs Good Questions

| Bad Question | Good Question |
| --- | --- |
| Do you think it’s a good idea? | Why do you bother? |
| Would you buy a product which did X? | What are the implications of that? Talk me through your workflow. |
| How much would you pay for X?	| What else have you tried? |
| What would your dream product do?	| How are you dealing with it now? |
| Would you pay X for a product that did Y?	| Who else should I talk to? |
| Do you think your husband would use this?	| Is there anything else I should have asked? |

# Five Great Interview Questions
- What is the hardest part about [doing this thing]?
- When is the last time you encountered this problem?
- Why was this hard?
- What, if anything, have you done to solve this problem?
- What don’t you love about the solution you already tried?

---

# Types of Bad Data
- Compliments
- Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, and the future)
- Ideas

---

# Keep it casual

- User interviews can be really casual.
- They might not even know about your product!

> "don't think up ideas, notice ideas"

---
# Add a way for users to contact you!

- contact link in footer to send an email

```
<a href="mailto:info@popping.live>Contact Us</a>
```

- You can even add a `body` and `subject` as query string params
---
# Send user registration email follow up
- Make sure you have a way to contact users
  - confirmed email
  - phone
- Welcome your new users!
